Besides thie extension trim spaces before and after model to fix possible copy/paste problems.

This module does not control old non-unique models (if non-unique models were added before using the module). 


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Before installation, make sure the OpenCart Extension Installer is correctly
configured, especially for the FTP settings, including the FTP Root.
See http://docs.opencart.com/extension/installer/ for more details!

In the OpenCart admin backend, do the following steps:

1. Please find the file control_unique_model_3x_asd.ocmod.zip for OpenCart 3.x 
    and upload it in the Extension Installer of your OpenCart. 

2. Then go to Extensions > Modifications and push the blue "Refresh" button in the upper right corner under the notification icon.
   (Better repeat it twice)	 
   Please make sure that you click the blue refresh button and not the browser refresh button.

That's it!

If during the install you get an error saying "Could not connect as ......" 
while uploading this zipped extension via the Extension Installer, 
you probably have the FTP support disabled from your hosting. 
In that case you may try the following OpenCart Extension Installer fix first:
